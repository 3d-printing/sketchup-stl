To support this community, SketchUp has gathered a couple of Ruby plugins and packaged them into a single Extension. Stay tuned! This is our first foray into Open Source, an experiment we hope to repeat.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nThe latest and greatest is available as an RBZ file. Download the file from this url:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-stl/raw/master/sketchup-stl-1.0.0.rbz\r\n\r\nThen inside SketchUp, select Preferences > Extensions > Install Extension and select the RBZ file you just downloaded. Voila! SketchUp installs the extension. You'll find a new import type under File > Import and a File > Export STL menu option as well.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you're a SketchUp Ruby community member, use git to grab the code, make some changes, then send us a pull request. (If you don't know what that is, that's okay, we barely know ourselves. Go google some github tutorials and give it a try. Please improve our README.md file with better instructions!)\r\n\r\nIf you're an owner of this repo, here are some steps.\r\n\r\nGet a local copy of the files. This will create a sketchup-stl folder.\r\n\r\n\tgit clone https://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-stl.git  \r\n\tcd sketchup-stl  \r\n\r\nUse your favorite editor to edit README.md. Then...\r\n\r\n\tgit add README.md                     // Marks README.md for edit.  \r\n\tgit commit -m \"Editing our README\"    // Records changes in the local branch.  \r\n\tgit push                              // Submits to repository. Yay!  \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSee the LICENSE and NOTICE files for more information.\r\n\r\nCopyright: Copyright (c) 2012 Trimble Navigation, Ltd.\r\n\r\nLicense: Apache License, Version 2.0\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.","note":"Don't delete this file!
