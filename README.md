# Welcome to SketchUp-STL

A SketchUp Ruby Extension that adds STL (STereoLithography) file format
import and export.

If you're an owner of the repo, to get the code and make a change, here are some steps.
(Documentation for non-owners coming soon.)

Get a local copy of the files. This will create a sketchup-stl folder.

	git clone https://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-stl.git  
	cd sketchup-stl  

Use your favorite editor to edit README.md. Then...

	git add README.md                     // Marks README.md for edit.  
	git commit -m "Editing our README"    // Records changes in the local branch.  
	git push                              // Submits to repository. Yay!
