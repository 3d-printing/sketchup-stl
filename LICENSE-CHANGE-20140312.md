Hi There

You are receiving this email because you are a contributor to SketchUp STL project. I'm reaching out directly because we would like to Change the license on this project.

Currently the license is the Apache version 2. We would like to change it to the MIT license. The MIT license is simpler and more appropriate for this kind of open source project. We are making this change as part of a lager clean up effort for all Trimble SketchUp's open source projects. This change will not affect your attribution as a contributor or limit any one's ability to make contributions in the future.

In order to change the license we need to obtain permission from all github project contributors and previous contributors. If wouldn't mind, please reply to this email stating whether you give permission to change the license to the MIT license. Note: if you are a Trimble employee, you do not need to reply.

If you have questions or concerns don't hesitate to let me know

Best Regards!

~Bryce Stout

Thanks Everyone! I've received permission from all contributors! We'll get the license updated in the next week or so.
